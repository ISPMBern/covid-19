# Welcome to our Living Systematic Review on COVID-19

On this website, we explain how we set up a *Living Systematic Review* that can:
* Collect evidence from different sources
* Deduplicates information according to different criteria
* Moves information to a central database
* Creates flexible output in RShiny [Like this](https://zika.ispm.unibe.ch/assets/data/pub/ncov/)

## Living systematic reviews

In our 2018 paper ([Counotte et al.](https://f1000research.com/articles/7-196/v1)), we describe the workflow of conducting a living systematic review.

We start by [**Collecting data**](collectingdata.html) from different data sources. [Here](collectingdata.html), we describe how to get references from medRxiv, bioRxiv and PubMed. We also include information from EMBASE via [Ovid](https://ovidsp.ovid.com/), but are we are currently not at liberty to share our methods. 

Once we have clean reference data from different sources, we perform [**Deduplication**](deduplication.html).
