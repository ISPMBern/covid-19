# Screening and annotation of citations


## Purpose
* Allows other research groups to start with a curated dataset
* Serves as training set (machine learning, classification)
* Allows us to track the accumulation of evidence over time (similar to [Counotte et al.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036806v1))
